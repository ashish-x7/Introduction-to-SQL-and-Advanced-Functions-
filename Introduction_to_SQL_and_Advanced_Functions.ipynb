        "SQL (Structured Query Language) commands are categorized into three main types based on their function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **DDL (Data Definition Language)**\n",
        "    *   **Purpose:** DDL commands are used to *define*, *modify*, or *delete* the structure of database objects (like tables, indexes, views, etc.). They deal with the schema of the database.\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Managing the database's blueprint.\n",
        "    *   **Effect:** Changes made by DDL commands are permanent and automatically committed (saved) to the database.\n",
        "    *   **Examples:** `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `RENAME`.\n",
        "    *   **Example:**\n",

        "    *   **Focus:** Managing the actual data content.\n",
        "    *   **Effect:** Changes made by DML commands are *not* automatically committed. They require a `COMMIT` statement to save changes or a `ROLLBACK` to undo them.\n",

        "    *   **Purpose:** DQL commands are used to *retrieve* data from the database. While sometimes grouped under DML because it's a form of data manipulation (reading), it's often distinguished because it doesn't modify the data.\n",
        "    *   **Focus:** Retrieving specific data sets.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Three Common Types of Constraints:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **PRIMARY KEY Constraint**\n",
        "    *   **Description:** A PRIMARY KEY uniquely identifies each record in a table. It must contain unique values, and it cannot contain NULL values. Each table can have only one primary key, which can consist of one or more columns.\n",
        "    *   **Scenario:** Imagine a `Students` table. Each student needs a unique identifier. An `StudentID` column with a PRIMARY KEY constraint would ensure that no two students have the same ID and that every student record has an ID.\n",

        "    *   **Description:** A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. It establishes and enforces a link between two tables, ensuring referential integrity. This means you cannot insert a row into the child table if the referenced value doesn't exist in the parent table's primary key.\n",

        "    *   **Scenario:** In an `Employees` table, it's essential that every employee has a `FirstName` and `LastName`. Applying a NOT NULL constraint to these columns would prevent records from being inserted or updated without these critical pieces of information.\n",

        "**Concept of SQL Normalization:**\n",
        "SQL Normalization is a systematic process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing a large table into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them. This process helps to ensure that data is stored logically and efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Primary Goals of Normalization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Eliminate Data Redundancy:** Avoid storing the same data multiple times in the database, which saves storage space and prevents inconsistencies.\n",
        "2.  **Ensure Data Integrity:** Maintain the accuracy and consistency of data. When data is stored in only one place, there's less chance of errors or discrepancies.\n",
        "3.  **Improve Data Efficiency:** Make the database easier to maintain and update. Changes to data only need to be made in one place.\n",
        "4.  **Enhance Query Performance (indirectly):** While complex joins might be needed, a well-normalized database can lead to more efficient queries by retrieving only necessary data and reducing the amount of data processed.\n",
        "5.  **Simplify Database Structure:** Make the database schema more logical and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Brief Explanation of the First Three Normal Forms:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Database normalization is typically carried out in stages, with each stage representing a \"normal form.\" The most common normal forms are 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **First Normal Form (1NF):**\n",
        "    *   **Rule:** A table is in 1NF if it meets two basic criteria:\n",
        "        *   **Atomic Values:** Each column must contain atomic (indivisible) values, meaning there are no repeating groups of columns or multi-valued attributes within a single cell.\n",
        "        *   **Unique Rows:** Each row must be unique, meaning there's a primary key that uniquely identifies each record.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Not 1NF):** A table `Customers` with a column `PhoneNumbers` containing \"123-4567, 987-6543\" in a single cell. This violates atomicity.\n",
        "    *   **To achieve 1NF:** Separate the multi-valued attribute into separate rows or a separate table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Second Normal Form (2NF):**\n",
        "    *   **Rule:** A table is in 2NF if it is already in 1NF **AND** all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key. This means that if a primary key is composite (made of two or more columns), no non-key attribute should depend on only *part* of the primary key.\n",
        "    *   **Example (Not 2NF):** Consider a table `Order_Details` with a composite primary key `(OrderID, ProductID)` and non-key attributes `ProductName` and `Quantity`. If `ProductName` depends only on `ProductID` (part of the primary key) and not on `OrderID`, then it's not in 2NF.\n",
        "    *   **To achieve 2NF:** Remove attributes that depend on only part of a composite primary key and place them in a separate table, linking them with a foreign key.\n",
